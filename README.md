Project title: Workforce Reallocation

Authors: Harsha Cheemakurthy, Anna Robbins

Short description:

Simulation of unemployment rates and reallocation into the workforce

Long description:

### Introduction:
As a result of COVID-19â€™s impact on different sectors, many people currently find themselves unemployed and looking for work.
They are trained professionals in their field with a variety of skills to offer, which may prove to be valuable resources
during the pandemic.

### Goal:
The goal of this project is to aid the government in reallocating the work force to where it is currently in high demand. A
concrete example is how flight attendants in the UK are receiving training in order to fill the demand for hospital employees.
By providing a simulation of the situation in Sweden, we can create a visual of the situation to demonstrate how reallocating
this part of the workforce reduces the demand for unemployment benefits and boosts the domestic economy.

### Target industries:
Tourism and hospitality, gambling, etc. -> delivery service, health care, etc.

### Suggestions for later implementation:
Crowdsourcing is often an excellent way of gathering new ideas and suggestions. The simulation can be gamified so that the
general public can simulate a realistic situation and solve how to successfully place all game actors into employment positions
and maximize productivity.
